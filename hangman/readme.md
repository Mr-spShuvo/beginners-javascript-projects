# 👹 Hangman Game

The popular Hangman Game built with JavaScript using `class` syntax and `fetch()` API.
For generating random words, I use the [random-word-api](https://random-word-api.herokuapp.com/word).

:pushpin: Rules for the hangman game play can be found [here](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)>).
